# ARel is ASTified #

* ARel 2.x rewrite uses an [Abstract Syntax Tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree)
* AST is a representation of source code as a Tree of Nodes (a.k.a. Tokens)
* An AST is used in the Ruby language parser to parse source code 
* ASTs can analize program logic, detect repetition, optimize, and convert
* ASTs are perfectly suited for SQL generation
